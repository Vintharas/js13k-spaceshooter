# JS13K SPACESHOOTER

- Start working on the game
  - TOPIC: OFFLINE
  - define story
    - firefly. smuggling/jobs. fun.
    - post apocaliptic story? Ai. melancholy.
  - goal of the game
    - survive in space before your energy runs out or you die
    - offline
      - as your energy drops your ship system's will go offline
      - systems
        - shield
        - radar
        - vision
        - shoot
        - thrust
        - solar slowly recharges your energy

## Prioritize

- complete basic offline mechanics
  - [*] radar
  - [*] disable stuff when no energy
    - [*] radar 4/5
    - [*] shield 3/5
    - [*] weapons 2/5
    - [*] vision 1/5 (reduce range of vision)
  - reorganize ships systems
    - there's a little bit of a mambo jambo and circular dependencies there
    - extract ShipsSystems object which enables/disables/makes sure you can perform a task
    - extract ShipWeapon to wrap shooting, etc
- complete faction selection process
  - 3 different ships
    - create art for two more ships
  - ships have slightly different stats
    - faction ship modifiers
  - 3 victory conditions
    - way to store game data
- all types of planets, suns
- suns recharge energy faster
- game engine
  - preload patterns for planets in loading screen so it won't affect fps in game
- support for multiple weapons

## BUILD - minimize assets to 13K

- Game engine improvements
  - scenes.
    - Separate background and foreground objects. There's no need to check
    - extract checking whether an object is viewable to the render method within the scene. We no longer need to do it per sprite? As I've been doing it
- Optimize build
  - test closure compiler
    - this is going to be a pain in the ass
    - consider loading kontra just by copying file as is to the dist folder
      and including it as is in the index.html template
    - setup compressor to just compress everything in dist/
  - test removing all the parts of kontra that I don't need
- TypeScript
  - use generics for kontra types

## CORE GAME MECHANICS

- ship energy
  - when you get near to a sun you get more energy faster
- shoot
  - support for other weapons:
    - bomb (explodes)
    - mine (leave it behind)
    - slower rate of shooting but stronger missile
- move
  - show speed indicator?
    - parsecs? (very huge speed units)
    - make sure that it make sense (the numbers)
  - tinker with the max speed
- map
  - iteratively generate map boundaries!!!! CORE to gameplay
  - generate some part of the galaxy as the game starts and then iteratively generate more as the player moves (planets, suns, etc)
  - large objects should have a fixed position and the plater should be able
    to come back to them
- asteroids generation
  - improve clusters to be x-close, or y-close, that will look cooler :D (I think, they will look more like a cluster)
  - add new clusters every so often (outside of the current camera view)
- ship life/collisions
  - when you collide with something or lose life, move the canvas with css like you're shaking. Add some reddish color in the actual screen.
  - collision decreases speed
  - improve collision algorithm to take types into account instead of requiring sorting
- shoot
  - add a sprite with a number that shows how much you got
    - in addition, it would be cool to show it beside the bar, as it increases
  - improvement in asteroids breaking
    - instead of destroying asteroid, makes asteroids smaller
    - energy moves towards the ship, when the ship is near
- energy and life cells
  - make energy, life be attracted by the ship
  - make the little energy ball do circular transitions
- shield
  - improve art and flickering animation
    - flicker when it goes off/on (perhaps we can flicker with low energy)
    - when enabled more around a little bit. Perhaps the origin can describe a circle itself
- planets
  - create some patterns for planets (bigger pattern? better algorithm?)
    - earth like planet
  - resources
    - improve: give resources only until you've filled up
      - if you have energy remaining, provide only energy
    - also planets have a limited number of resources that regenerate over time
      - interesting if some types of planets have more of some resource
      - food could be a third resource
  - planets need to be claimed by the faction before they can be used to
    gather resources! (cool xD)
    - [*] over time a defense orbiting station is built on the planet
  - some planets have moons
  - cool ideas
    - get jobs
    - fullfill quests
    - sell resources (pillaging/asteroid mining/etc) in exchange for money/equipment/goods
- suns
  - proximity to sun hurts you
  - proximity to sun boost normal rate of energy acquisition
  - have two rings outer, inner (green/red) or something
  - it'd be cool if we could arrange planets around a sun
  - and make them orbit the sun slowly, that would be cool :D
- radar
  - [*] show interesting stuff (like a minimap)
  - separate scene background from foreground sprites!!
  - deactivate when energy is not sufficient
  - activate when energy sufficient
  - add ships/sun/enemies, etc
- vision
  - diminish range of vision (player sees less space, rest becomes darker)
- enable/disable systems based on energy left
  - [*] shield 4/5
  - radar (needs to be implemented yet) 3/5
    - make simple implementation
  - vision 2/5
  - shoot 1/5
  - thrust
  - life support?
- game messages
  - implement so that not two overlapping texts appear at the same time (offline/online). Add some sort of message queueing system
  - have a queue with 3 slots that can be filled with text (f.i.)
- ways to lose
  - crushed by an asteroid
  - been too near a sun
  - black holes?
  - beasts and enemies attack you
  - too low energy? Life support disabled for a long period of time?
- smart enemies:
  - other factions
  - reapers
  - galatic empire, etc
  - AIs
  - creatures
- a way to deliver story. what story? :)
- game engine
  - extract all variables so they're configurable from a single point
  - this could be altered by a UI in realtime and allow me to tweak the game
- different difficulty levels
  - higher cost for actions
- end escene
  - show explosion of your ship then move to end screen with scores and such
  - overdo the explosion
  - then move to scores scene
- scoreboard
  - saved in localstorage
- Initial screens
  - title
  - choose faction (see summary of story)
    - select one of the three, then panel slides with story, ship info, goal
    - factions have different looks and stats for the ship and different game goals
    - blue/science/find orion
    - green/commerce/gather x amount of energy
    - red/dominion/control x amount of planets
- Ilumination
  - it would be cool to do something with ilumination
  - moving objects being illuminated by larger objects like suns/planets which either produce or reflect light. That would add some dynamism to the ships.
- Performance
  - profile and review performance
  - think of stuff you can do to improve performance and memory consumption
- More offline theme (use workbox)
  - PWA with precaching of game assets
  - Add application manifest so it can be installed
- Canvas
  - resize canvas on windows change

## Art

- pixel art for everything
- ship
  - [*] particle systems for ship thrust
  - [*] particle system for explosions/impacts
  - [*] animate collisions
  - [*] test creating a pixel on piksel
  - [*] make pixel moooore pixelated :) Looks better I think :)
  - show when the ship gets damage
    - tink in red
- particles
  - review particle system
  - it would be could if i could experiment with an editor and
    change the different parameters I have and see how the affect
    the particles
    - build this!
- asteroids
  - [*] test creating a texture procedurally
    - looks interesting but it doesn't work out so well with the circular shapes. I should try to create shapes that are less circular. Perhaps using paths of closing angles, with an arbitrary number of sides.
  - [*] wrote algorithm to generate polygonal shapes
  - continue improving algorithm so it matches the collision detection
    - I can write an equation so find the right location in a circle given an angle. And get the right length. (Although this will result in less egdy shapes)
  - rotate as well as translate
- planets
  - [*] test generating a texture procedurally as well
  - I could approach it as using different patterns for different layers:
    - seas
    - then landmasses
    - then clouds
    - it'd be cool if the clouds would move
  - idem
- enemy ships, etc
- Music
  - ?
- Find a name for the game :D

## BUGS

- for some reason, a broken down asteroid doesn't collide with the ship, although it does collide with bullets. #wat

# HISTORY 25 AUGUST

## BUILD - minimize assets to 13K

- Optimize build
  - [*] Kontra is included as an unminifed raw string :/ - included min.js as part of the game source code
  - [*] styles loader takes 10K minified - removed and inlined styles
  - [*] right not it seems I'm about ~8Kb only framework and stuff
  - test closure compiler
  - test removing all the parts of kontra that I don't need

## CORE GAME MECHANICS

- ship energy
  - [*] ship energy indicator
  - [*] suns slowly recharge energy
  - when you get near to a sun you get more energy faster
- move
  - [*] move affects energy
  - [*] cant move if you dont have energy enough
  - [*] move around a map of fixed size? (more or less)
  - [*] don't render stuff that is not in the visible area
    - (is canvas smart enough to do this or do I need to take it into account?)
  - [*] add particles to moving (back and front)
  - show speed indicator?
    - [*] create some speed indicator
    - parsecs? (very huge speed units)
    - make sure that it make sense (the numbers)
  - tinker with the max speed
  - [*] enabling pressing back to diminish forward speed (less strong than forward but same amount of energy)
  - [*] make canvas BIGGER! Take the whole screen! :)
  - [*] save middle points in a config file and use them in the game
- map
  - iteratively generate map boundaries!!!! CORE to gameplay
  - generate some part of the galaxy as the game starts and then iteratively generate more as the player moves (planets, suns, etc)
  - large objects should have a fixed position and the plater should be able
    to come back to them
- asteroids generation
  - [*] come from random location at random speed
  - [*] different size
  - [*] create clusters of asteroids
  - improve clusters to be x-close, or y-close, that will look cooler :D (I think, they will look more like a cluster)
  - add new clusters every so often (outside of the current camera view)
- ship life/collisions
  - [*] life and life indicator for the ship
  - [*] collisions reduces life
  - [*]BUUUUUG collisions seem not to be working 100%
    - [*] they don't work for asteroids generated when one other asteroid is broken?
    - [*] Fix, the issue was the collision algorithm which wasn't checking the collision between new asteroids and the ship (the ship was already considered collision free)
  - [*] asteroid breaks on collision (or disintegrates depending on size)
  - when you collide with something or lose life, move the canvas with css like you're shaking. Add some reddish color in the actual screen.
  - collision decreases speed
  - improve collision algorithm to take types into account instead of requiring sorting
- shoot
  - [*] shooting spends energy
  - [*] shooting at asteroids releases components -> energy, life
  - [*] energy, life is absorved by the ship when the ship approaches
  - [*] add a sprite with a number that shows how much you got
    - [*] on top of the collision
    - in addition, it would be cool to show it beside the bar
  - [*] bullets should have particles behind
  - improvement in asteroids breaking
    - instead of destroying asteroid, makes asteroids smaller
    - energy moves towards the ship, when the ship is near
- energy and life cells
  - [*] energy and life cells
  - make energy, life be attracted by the ship
  - make the little energy ball do circular transitions
- shield
  - [*] shield is available when you have max energy > 4/5
  - [*] it recharges at the same speed as energy (so when it is on, energy doesn't recharge) (the baseline for energy)
  - [*] if energy goes low or it is broken it disappears
  - [*] BUG!!! fix fix!
    - [*] there seems to be a bug with the shield not coming online!!
  - improve art and flickering animation
    - flicker when it goes off/on (perhaps we can flicker with low energy)
    - when enabled more around a little bit. Perhaps the origin can describe a circle itself
- stars
  - [*] testing sprites so far
  - [*] two different layers with different speeds and intensity
  - [*] moving as the camera moves
  - stars as tilesets or sprites?
    - sprites, very easy to create
      - perhaps harder to distribute at an "even" way around the ship
      - I think I have a working solution there
    - tiles, can create a parallax effect much easier
      - hmm I could make the camera movement affect more
        nearer background stuff as well, that should work
  - can I make stars with a tileset?
- planets
  - [*] dotted circle and planet
  - create some patterns for planets (bigger pattern? better algorithm?)
    - [*] green planet
    - [*] red planet
    - [*] blue ice planet
    - earth like planet
  - resources
    - [*] you get resources if you get near the dotted circle
    - [*] more resources
    - [*] you can recharge resources by orbiting near planets
    - improve: give resources only until you've filled up
      - if you have energy remaining, provide only energy
    - also planets have a limited number of resources that regenerate over time
      - interesting if some types of planets have more of some resource
      - food could be a third resource
  - [*] give planets names
  - planets need to be claimed by the faction before they can be used to
    gather resources! (cool xD)
    - claim orbiting an unclaimed planet for some seconds
    - claimed planets get a ring of your factions color
    - over time a defense orbiting station is built on the planet
  - some planets have moons
  - cool ideas
    - get jobs
    - fullfill quests
    - sell resources (pillaging/asteroid mining/etc) in exchange for money/equipment/goods

  - have two rings outer, inner (green/red) or something
  - it'd be cool if we could arrange planets around a sun
  - and make them orbit the sun slowly, that would be cool :D
- stars
  - stars give you energy faster
  - but if you get too near you die
- shield (implemented above)
  - [*] slowly drains energy (same speed as sun in lowest charge)
  - [*] protects ship hull
- radar
  - show interesting stuff (like a minimap)
- vision
